# Automobile-Crawler-App

The AllenOne (all-in-one) is a web scraping application that uses three tools - flask (a micro-web framework written in python based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine), mechanize (a way to interact with webpages with a browser-like object), and BeautifulSoup (a module used for pulling data out of html). The application extracts postings from Kijiji, Wheels, Carpages, Autotrader, and Craigslist, and feeds the content to a dynamic webpage. The website and application facilitate the search for a used car by providing postings from the most visited automobile trading websites, on one easy-to-use webpage. Interactive Website has been deployed on Heroku. and can be accessed through the following link: https://automobilescraper.herokuapp.com/
